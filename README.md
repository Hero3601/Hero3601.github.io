## Timer

**a Timer using HTML5 and CSS3 and JS**

**-------------------------------------------------------**

**Hello , Programmers !**


**Finally i could deploy this repo**


**So , this is my first repo that actually works fine and before opening the timer webpage remember that if you want to set it for a minute you should type 60
and if you want a hour you should type 3600 until we try to change**



**also the website still has issues like when you press cancel in the time-interface the time will be set as -1 and the alarm sound will be played**


**Hope to like the Timer**



**and thanks for dxvrxv for contributing**
